BREAKDOWN OF BUNDLE BP063-BU-01000-r0p1-00rel0

This directory contains bundled deliverables from ARM. Bundled deliverables
are a way of grouping deliverables together for ease of use but which also
need to be identified separately for contractual reasons. This file shows
the breakdown of the bundled data into its constituent deliverables and
files.  It is provided mainly for information for delivery tracking, but
may be useful in the event of problems being found with particular files
and tracing the origin of the files for communication with ARM's support
group.
